Getting Started
Welcome to the NM i AI 2026 documentation. The competition kicks off March 19, 2026 — but right now, you can get a head start with the Grocery Bot Challenge, a pre-competition warm-up to get familiar with the platform and get the competitive spirit going.
What's Live Right Now

Team registration — sign up with Google, create or join a team
Grocery Bot Challenge — build a bot that controls a swarm of workers in a grocery store
Leaderboard — compete for the top spot across 4 difficulty maps

The main competition tasks (Computer Vision, Language Model, Machine Learning) will be revealed when the competition launches on March 19.
Grocery Bot Challenge
The Grocery Bot is a warm-up challenge to get you familiar with the platform and have some fun before the real competition starts.
How it works:

Sign in at app.ainm.no with Google
Create or join a team
Go to the Challenge page, pick a difficulty, click Play
Connect your bot via WebSocket and respond with actions each round
Your best score per map is saved — leaderboard = sum of all 4 maps

Read the full Grocery Bot documentation for the complete API spec, game mechanics, and example code.
Quick Overview
Your bot connects to the game server via WebSocket. Each round, the server sends you the full game state and you respond with actions for your bots.
Server sends game state → Your Bot (via WebSocket)
         ↓
Your bot returns actions for each bot
         ↓
Game state updates, next round begins
         ↓
Repeat for up to 300 rounds (120s wall-clock limit)

How to Run
Your bot runs locally as a Python script that connects to the game server:
import asyncio
import websockets
 
async def play():
    async with websockets.connect("wss://game.ainm.no/ws?token=YOUR_TOKEN") as ws:
        while True:
            state = await ws.recv()
            # ... decide actions ...
            await ws.send('{"actions": [...]}')
 
asyncio.run(play())
Get a token by clicking "Play" on a map at app.ainm.no/challenge.
Requirements

Python 3.10+ with websockets library (pip install websockets)
Respond within 2 seconds per round
Handle game_over messages to exit cleanly
